# DigitalClock_usingC
## Introduction
You have to develop a digital clock that prints the current time, and date on the linux terminal. If a color is given as an argument to the program, the program should be able to print a colored output. You will be given a sample program (prog) that would do the same task. Your task is to replicate the functionality of the given program. Below figures show the expected output from your program.

## Inputs:
Command-line arguments:
- If a colour is given as an argument to the program with the ‘-c’ flag, the program
should be able to print the clock using the given colour. If no argument is given, use
black and white as default.

Eg: ./prog -c red

- These colors should be supported by the program - black, red, green, yellow, blue,
magenta, cyan
- If -h flag is given or the given arguments are invalid, you should print the usages of
your program (how the arguments should be given). See the sample binary given for
the expected behaviour.
