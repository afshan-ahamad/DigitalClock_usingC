# DigitalClock_usingC
## Introduction
I have developed a digital clock that prints the current time, and date on the linux terminal. If a color is given as an argument to the program, the program will print a colored output.

## Inputs:
Command-line arguments:
- If a colour is given as an argument to the program with the ‘-c’ flag, the program
will print the clock using the given colour. If no argument is given, I have used
black and white as default.

Eg: ./prog -c red

- These colors are supported by the program - black, red, green, yellow, blue,
magenta, cyan
- If -h flag is given or the given arguments are invalid, program will  print the usages of
the program (how the arguments should be given).
