# DigitalClock_usingC
## Introduction
You have to develop a digital clock that prints the current time, and date on the linux terminal. If a color is given as an argument to the program, the program should be able to print a colored output. You will be given a sample program (prog) that would do the same task. Your task is to replicate the functionality of the given program. Below figures show the expected output from your program.

## Inputs:
Command-line arguments:
● If a colour is given as an argument to the program with the ‘-c’ flag, the program
should be able to print the clock using the given colour. If no argument is given, use
black and white as default.






Eg: ./prog -c red
